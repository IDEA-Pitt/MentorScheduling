# MentorScheduling
A python algorithm to pull availability and schedule mentors for the makerspaces at Pitt.

Some Notes to myself
- I totally should have set up a virtual environment. I haven't gotten too far so it still may be worth it. We'll see. It's good practice but
I doubt it would be that helpful to the current lab. However assuming more people come in later on, I definitely should have.
